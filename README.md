# S32 Peripheral Access Crates

This repository provids Rust device support crates for all S32 microcontrollers, with a safe API to that device's peripherals generated by [svd2rust](https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust).

## Generating Device Crates

- Install `svd2rust`, `svdtools`, and `form`
- Install rustfmt `rustup component add rustfmt
- Generate patched SVD fiels: `make patch` (optionally you can use `-j` to speed up operations)
- Generate svd2rust device crates: `make svd2rust`
- Optionally, format device crates: `make form`
